            <h2>Sexual Assualt Response Coordinator</h2>
            <p>The Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) plays a pivotal role in the Coast Guard, primarily handling reports of sexual assault while also serving as a knowledgeable resource for individuals in need. They navigate the often sensitive and uncomfortable conversations surrounding sexual assault, ensuring victims feel supported and understood. The SARC also collaborates closely with the Victim Advocate Program Specialist (VAPS), offering comprehensive case management, while the VAPS provides specialized support directly to victims. This partnership allows for a holistic approach to addressing sexual assault within the Coast Guard community. Furthermore, the SARC offers guidance to command and delivers briefings to board members, emphasizing the importance of addressing and preventing sexual assault. Cell phones serve as the primary mode of contact for individuals seeking assistance and can be found on posters around Chase Hall and the academic buildings, mainly around the heads. Additionally, their offices are located on the 1st deck of Chase Hall.</p>
