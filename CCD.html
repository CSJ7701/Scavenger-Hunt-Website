            <h2>Center for Counseling and Development</h2>
            <p>The Center for Counseling and Development (CCD) at the Coast Guard Academy is dedicated to supporting cadets in achieving their personal, academic, and military aspirations. By focusing on a comprehensive range of skills, encompassing emotional and social development, CCD psychologists aim to cultivate capable leadership within the Coast Guard. As the primary resource for preventive mental healthcare, the CCD offers counseling, psychotherapy, and training.  Cadets come to the CCD to discuss on-going stress, relationships, life transitions, anxiety, depression, eating/ body image concerns, family matters, alcohol use, etc.  Counseling is not part of cadetsâ€™ Academic, C-Division, or Medical records.

Services are confidential, including for cadets who experience sexual assault or harassment.  CCD does not require cadets to make a report to receive care.   

 
The CCD is open from Monday to Friday, 0800 to 1600, excluding holidays.  Cadets can set an appointment by emailing CGACounselingcenter@uscga.edu or calling 860-444-8520.</p>
