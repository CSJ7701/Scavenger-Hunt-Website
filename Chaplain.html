            <h2>Chaplains</h2>
            <p>Here at the Coast Guard Academy, the chaplains offer a multifaceted array of services to meet the spiritual and emotional needs of all servicemembers. Primarily, they conduct religious services aligned with their faith group while also accommodating those outside their denomination. Beyond traditional religious duties, they facilitate group discussions and bible studies, fostering a sense of community among cadets and faculty/staff. What sets Coast Guard chaplains apart is their role as counselors, providing confidential support â€” an aspect unique to the Coast Guard. This confidentiality extends to all interactions, as they are not mandatory reporters, allowing individuals to seek guidance without fear of repercussion. Serving as both triage and referral points, they connect individuals with appropriate counseling resources and provide a listening ear for those in need. Chaplains offer invaluable moral guidance to command, serving as a moral compass within the organization. They can be found primarily in their offices on the 2nd deck of Leamy Hall but also frequent the chapel. Father Tom Ianucci can be reached directly at 757-497-7734.</p>
