            <h2>Cadet Command</h2>
            <p>All members of command have a commitment to the well-being of the corps as a whole. Cadet command, either Regimental or Company, can serve as an important resource for addressing any challenges or difficulties that cadets may encounter during their time at the academy. Important resources often include lower levels of the chain of command, like your division, or for more urgent matters could include Company or even Regimental Staff. When on liberty or leave, reaching out to the CHDO ((860) 625-2013) for information or emergency assistance is a great option. It's important to remember that, while cadets are encouraged to support and care for one another, they are not professionals, and typically not trained to handle mental health issues. Sometimes, however, talking to a peer can help resolve issues before they become more extensive. </p>
