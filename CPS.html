            <h2>Cadet Peer Support</h2>
            <p>Cadet Peer Support (CPS) plays a crucial role as a mental health resource for cadets during their time at CGA. CPS members offer a confidential platform for discussing Class I, II, or III offenses, including those related to mental health issues, without the fear of being called to testify (this includes underage drinking). Their role as confidential listeners ensures that cadets feel safe to share their concerns without repurcussions. CPS members are always available to provide support and assistance to cadets in need of someone to talk to. Please note that CPS members <i>may</i> be called by CGIS if they are investigating a crime.</p>
